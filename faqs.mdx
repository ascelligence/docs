  <Accordion title="Will Kyvic slow down my website?">
    No. Our security checks run on a highly optimized global edge network. For most users, the difference in latency is negligible and often imperceptible. We strongly recommend using the "DNS Only" setting for your CNAME record to ensure the fastest possible connection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I know if Kyvic is working?">
    The easiest way is to try and access your site from a new private Browse window, you may be presented with a challenge. Over time, you should also notice a significant drop in spam comments, junk form submissions, and suspicious traffic in your server logs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if my own server goes down?">
    Kyvic protects your site, but it can't serve your content if your origin server is offline. Visitors will see our captcha challenge, but after solving it, they will receive an error message since we cannot connect to your server.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I customize the look of the captcha page?">
    Currently, we offer a standard, clean interface designed for clarity and speed. We are planning to introduce customization options for our business customers in the future.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will this affect my website's SEO in a negative way?">
    Absolutely not. Protecting your site's SEO is a core principle of Kyvic. Our system leverages Cloudflare's powerful bot detection to intelligently analyze your traffic before it even reaches your site.

    We have configured our system to automatically identify and grant access to verified bots that are beneficial to your site's visibility and operations. This includes bots in categories such as:

    - **Search Engine Crawlers:** These bots index your site for search results. _(e.g., Googlebot, Bingbot, YandexBot, DuckDuckGo Bot)_
    - **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** These are tools you or your marketing team might use to analyze and improve your site's ranking and performance. _(e.g., Google Lighthouse, AhrefsBot, SemrushBot, Moz's Rogerbot, Screaming Frog)_
    - **Advertising & Marketing:** These bots verify ad placements or generate link previews for social sharing. _(e.g., GoogleAdsBot, LinkedInBot, Pinterestbot)_
    - **Essential Webhooks:** These are services that need to communicate with your site for critical functions like payment processing and automation. _(e.g., Stripe, Slackbot, Zapier)_

    These trusted bots are always allowed to access and index your content without being challenged.

    Conversely, Kyvic is designed to challenge suspicious and unwanted traffic. This specifically includes aggressive **AI data scrapers** that harvest your content for training models, as well as other unidentified, malicious, or non-essential bots.

    The result is a website that is fully protected from harmful traffic while ensuring that the bots essential for your search ranking always have access.

  <Accordion title="Do you store my visitors' personal data?">
    No. Kyvic is a **privacy-first** service. We act as a pass-through security gateway and do not store your website's content or any sensitive personal information from your visitors. All traffic is processed in real-time to perform security checks and is not permanently logged or stored.

    Please read more about this in our [Privacy Policy](https://kyvic.com/privacy-policy).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My site's images or styles look broken. What should I do?">
    This almost always happens when your website uses multiple subdomains for assets (e.g., `cdn.example.com` or `assets.example.com`). Please ensure you have added **every subdomain** to your Kyvic Console and configured its DNS record correctly. This is the most common setup issue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I exceed my plan's usage limit?">
    When your account reaches **85%** of your plan's traffic limit, you'll see a notification in your Kyvic Console and receive an email reminder to consider upgrading.

    **Important:** To avoid any service interruption, upgrade to a higher tier before hitting 100% of your limit. If your usage exceeds your plan's allocation, your service will be automatically suspended for the remainder of the billing cycle, as outlined in our [Terms and Conditions](https://kyvic.com/terms-and-conditions).

    We recommend monitoring your usage regularly, especially during traffic spikes, to ensure uninterrupted protection for your site.
