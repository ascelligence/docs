Modern bots are smart, but they lack the true consciousness and nuanced logic of the human brain. Kyvic Aegis leverages this fundamental gap. Our neuro-based illusions are designed to be effortlessly solved by your human visitors while presenting an insurmountable logical barrier to automated systems.

Think of it as a friendly handshake for humans and an unbreachable wall for bots.

## Our Protection Model (Early Access)

During the Early Access phase, Kyvic Aegis uses a time-based protection model. This means a quick neuro-based challenge is periodically shown to visitors to verify they are human. The timing of this check is unique to each individual user, not an event that happens to everyone at once.

We use this direct approach for our initial release for two key reasons:

1. **Maximum Effectiveness Against AI:** Our primary neuro-based challenges are engineered to be a formidable barrier, making it extremely difficult for AI crawlers and scrapers to penetrate your site. However, since no security system can guarantee 100% infallibility, we've built in a powerful fail-safe. The periodic, mandatory check ensures that in the rare event a highly advanced bot manages to slip past our initial defenses, the threat is neutralized at the next checkpoint, preventing any malicious presence from lingering.
2. **Reliability Over Complexity:** While more advanced behavioral analysis is on our roadmap, this time-based system is incredibly robust and predictable. It provides a strong, consistent security baseline for all our early users without the risk of errors that can come from more complex (and sometimes faulty) detection systems.

## Platform Compatibility

Kyvic operates as an edge reverse proxy, sitting between your visitors and your server. To set it up, you'll need the ability to modify your domain's **DNS records** (specifically, the CNAME and TXT records).

Our service works best for websites operating on a **single domain** (e.g., `www.example.com`). It also fully supports sites that load resources from **multiple subdomains** (e.g., `assets.example.com`). Please be aware, some sites have strict browser security policies (like CORS or CSP) that control how resources are shared between domains. If you encounter issues with assets not loading, a minor configuration adjustment by your web developer may be needed.

For maximum security, we strongly recommend protecting any critical subdomains with Kyvic as well. This creates a comprehensive shield and prevents **origin IP/hostname exposure**, making it significantly harder for attackers to target your server directly.

| **DRM-Protected Video/Media** (e.g., Netflix clones)                 | ‚ùå **No**                 | Our proxy can interfere with the secure Digital Rights Management (DRM) path required for protected content. |

<Note>
  **A Note on Managed Platforms (Shopify, WordPress.com, etc.)**

  Here's the thing about managed platforms: you don't get the same firewall control you'd have with a self-hosted server. That's why we lean on the "secret subdomain" method as your main defense against bypass attempts (check out our Quickstart Guide for Managed Platforms for details).

  Now, this approach plays by the platform's rules, and those rules can shift over time, so your mileage may vary. Generally speaking, static-content platforms like [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com), Blogger, GitHub Pages, or Netlify tend to play nicely with this setup.

  Dynamic platforms like Shopify? They're a bit trickier. Since the platform controls so much of how your site works, there's less predictability. Some dynamic platforms will work great, while others... not so much. It really depends on the specific platform.
