Modern AI vision models are impressive, but they still struggle with challenges that exploit fundamental gaps in machine perception. Kyvic Aegis is built on this principle.

Our challenges have been tested against the most advanced AI systems available, including GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, with a detection accuracy below 1%. In testing, these models frequently hallucinated responses or failed to process the challenge entirely, even timing out before completing analysis.

Meanwhile, human visitors solve these same challenges quickly and intuitively, without deep frustration.

**Important caveat:** AI capabilities advance rapidly. While our challenges are highly effective against current-generation models (tested as of 2025), we continuously monitor AI developments and update our defenses accordingly. No security system is permanently unbreakable, which is why we use a time-based verification model as an additional fail-safe.

## Our Protection Model (Early Access)

During the Early Access phase, Kyvic Aegis uses a time-based protection model. This means a quick neuro-based challenge is periodically shown to visitors to verify they are human. The timing of this check is unique to each individual user, not an event that happens to everyone at once.

We use this direct approach for our initial release for two key reasons:

1. **Maximum Effectiveness Against AI:** Our primary neuro-based challenges are engineered to be a formidable barrier, making it extremely difficult for AI crawlers and scrapers to penetrate your site. However, since no security system can guarantee 100% infallibility, we've built in a powerful fail-safe. The periodic, mandatory check ensures that in the rare event a highly advanced bot manages to slip past our initial defenses, the threat is neutralized at the next checkpoint, preventing any malicious presence from lingering.
2. **Reliability Over Complexity:** While more advanced behavioral analysis is on our roadmap, this time-based system is incredibly robust and predictable. It provides a strong, consistent security baseline for all our early users without the risk of errors that can come from more complex (and sometimes faulty) detection systems.

## Platform Compatibility

Kyvic operates as an edge reverse proxy, sitting between your visitors and your server. To set it up, you'll need the ability to modify your domain's **DNS records** (specifically, the CNAME and TXT records).

Our service works best for websites operating on a **single domain** (e.g., `www.example.com`). It also fully supports sites that load resources from **multiple subdomains** (e.g., `assets.example.com`). Please be aware, some sites have strict browser security policies (like CORS or CSP) that control how resources are shared between domains. If you encounter issues with assets not loading, a minor configuration adjustment by your web developer may be needed.

For maximum security, we strongly recommend protecting any critical subdomains with Kyvic as well. This creates a comprehensive shield and prevents **origin IP/hostname exposure**, making it significantly harder for attackers to target your server directly.

<Note>
  **An Important Note on Managed Platforms (WordPress.com, Shopify, etc.)**

  Managed platforms don't offer the same firewall control as self-hosted servers. That's why we currently use the "secret subdomain" method to obfuscate your origin (see our Quickstart Guide for Managed Platforms).

  <br />

  **The reality:** Your secret subdomain can leak through SSL certificate transparency logs, search engines, or historical DNS records. If discovered, attackers can bypass Kyvic by accessing it directly.

  <br />

  **Why it still matters:** This approach stops automated scrapers and casual attackers who aren't actively hunting for origins. It's not foolproof, but it raises the barrier significantly since most bots and bad actors won't invest the effort to search certificate logs or DNS history.

  <br />

  **Platform reliability varies:** static platforms (WordPress.com, Blogger, GitHub Pages, Netlify) tend to work well, while dynamic platforms like Shopify are less predictable.

  <br />

  **Looking ahead:** We're actively researching more robust protection methods for managed platforms that don't rely on origin obscurity. For now, this provides meaningful protection for most scenarios. Facing sophisticated and targeted attacks? Self-hosted solutions offer the strongest security controls.
